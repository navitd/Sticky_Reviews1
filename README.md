# Sticky_Reviews1
The Data Incubator Capstone Project

Sticky reviews are consumer reviews that start a sequence of low-scorring reviews.
In this work I define and analyze sticky reviews.

I start out with the Amazon Reviews data (1,689,188 reviews) downloaded from:
http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/

##### 01 Sticky Reviews histogram contains the initial analysis (histograms) that define the sticky reviews
but not the initial steps of downloading the data.
